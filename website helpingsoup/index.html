            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            Our mission is to collect and provide non perishable food products to soup kitchens around Florida.
            We intend to help soup kitchens during the covid 19 pandemic as many are running out of raw materials to operate.
            We are a non-profit organization aimed at helping the community of the homeless and underprivaleged.
